# Experiments

## Method and source

The FastAPI `GET /api/experiments` route calls `run_all_experiments()` on the active scenario. The default comes from `data/scenarios/commerce.json`; the five Level examples are under `data/scenarios/examples/`. The runner discovers candidate pairs and chains from declared formal preconditions, effects, required inputs, and capability types. It does not depend on fixed commerce capability IDs. It returns seven groups: the five required assignment experiments plus state/goal encoding and state awareness.

The captured results below were returned by a running local API at `http://127.0.0.1:8012`. Port `8012` is historical for these captures; normal local setup uses `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. For each dataset, I loaded its JSON using `POST /api/scenario` and then captured `GET /api/experiments`; the API was reset to commerce after the checks. Values below are copied from those responses. Floating-point display is the API's actual output.

## Required experiments and measures

1. **Capability compatibility:** find one compatible and one incompatible ordered pair; report requirement evidence and failure reasons. A pair is directional.
2. **Capability composition:** locate a compatible ordered chain of at least three capabilities, return the composite capability/vector, and measure aggregate cost, reliability, and availability.
3. **Alternative implementations:** identify capabilities with matching precondition/effect signatures but different declared types and compare section-weighted capability cosine.
4. **Goal relevance:** report exact goal-effect overlap, fraction of goal conditions covered, and effect-space cosine for each capability.
5. **Operational attributes:** report declared time, reliability, availability, and, when a chain qualifies, its aggregate cost and products.

The supplementary groups encode the first state and goal and evaluate the first state against the first capability's preconditions and constraints.

The compatible pair's response had two satisfied checks: consumer precondition `Order.exists=true` was supplied by the producer effect, and required `order_id: UUID` by the producer output. The incompatible pair lacked `Payment.status=SUCCESS` and a `payment_id: UUID` output. The API also returned non-alias pair data: `create-order-db__create-order-gui` similarity was `0.73736739`.

## Level 2 compatible pair: captured output excerpt

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "level-2-compatible-pair",
  "experiments": [
    {
      "id": "compatibility",
      "results": {
        "compatible_pair": {
          "compatible": true,
          "producer_id": "create-order",
          "consumer_id": "make-payment",
          "evidence": [
            {"requirement": "precondition", "name": "Order.exists", "satisfied": true}
          ],
          "reasons": []
        }
      }
    },
    {"id": "three_capability_composition", "skipped": "needs a compatible chain of at least 3 capabilities"},
    {"id": "alternative_implementations", "skipped": "no matching precondition/effect group with differing types"},
    {"id": "operational_properties", "skipped": "needs alternative implementations or a three-capability chain"}
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "capability_count": 2,
    "state_count": 2,
    "goal_count": 1,
    "embedding_dimensions_observed": 22
  }
}
```

With two capabilities, the example can demonstrate compatibility, but groups requiring a longer chain or alternatives have no qualifying input. A skip records why an experiment does not apply; it is not a failed experiment or runtime error.

## Level 3 full-chain example: captured output excerpt

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "level-3-full-chain",
  "experiments": [
    {"id": "three_capability_composition", "skipped": "needs a compatible chain of at least 3 capabilities"},
    {"id": "alternative_implementations", "skipped": "no matching precondition/effect group with differing types"},
    {"id": "operational_properties", "skipped": "needs alternative implementations or a three-capability chain"},
    {"id": "state_awareness", "results": {"applicable": true}}
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "capability_count": 3,
    "state_count": 4,
    "goal_count": 1,
    "embedding_dimensions_observed": 31
  }
}
```

Although its name describes a chain, the runner's formal checks do not find a valid three-link chain in this file. For example, a later stage requiring `Payment.status=NOT_STARTED` needs a matching earlier equality effect; the current prior stage does not declare that effect. The runner bases its result on formal handoff data rather than the example name.

## Level 5 everything example: captured output excerpt

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "level-5-everything",
  "experiments": [
    {"id": "three_capability_composition", "skipped": "needs a compatible chain of at least 3 capabilities"},
    {
      "id": "alternative_implementations",
      "results": {
        "functional_similarity": {
          "api_database": {"similarity": 0.76934296},
          "api_gui": {"similarity": 0.74050302},
          "create-order-database__create-order-gui": {"similarity": 0.67087813}
        }
      }
    },
    {"id": "goal_relevance", "results": {"irrelevant": ["get-weather"]}}
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "capability_count": 6,
    "state_count": 4,
    "goal_count": 1,
    "embedding_dimensions_observed": 45
  }
}
```

Level 5 supplies alternatives and an irrelevant capability, but its declared intermediate preconditions still do not yield a compatible three-stage chain under the current checks.

## Explicit composite dataset

`data/scenarios/composition-example.json` contains two atomic capabilities and a declared `COMPOSITE` with ordered component IDs. I submitted the two atomic entries to `POST /api/compose`; the captured response was `compose:prepare-order->confirm-order`, with one compatible link, reliability `0.9702`, availability `0.9506`, and time `40.0 ms`. The dataset itself was also accepted by `POST /api/experiments/run` as scenario `composition-example` with three capabilities.

## Interpretation and limits

Similarity is representation resemblance, not a compatibility probability. Exact feature-name overlap and the declared category weights shape scores. The goal relevance coverage is a direct matching-effect ratio. The reported scenarios are demonstrations, not statistical validation or a performance benchmark. Costs are declarations from the scenario. Chain reliability and availability multiply as if component outcomes are independent. Results depend on scenario formality: missing effects or typed outputs can make an intended real-world handoff fail the symbolic check.
